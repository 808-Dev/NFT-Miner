# NFT Miner 
NFT Miner - Version 1.0.0 - Quick Fix

Since the whole NFT thing started booming on Twitter it's been hard not to see one of those ugly ass monkeys or lions in my fucking feed. I know you can mute stuff, but I'm petty. So, in response to these annoying as fuck incel hypebeasts shoving their picture of a lion that looks like it was dropped on its head, I created the worlds first NFT Miner.

<h1>Does it mine crypto?</h1>

No, but if you want to you can piss alot of people off with it.

<h1>Is it illegal?</h1>

No, because it's basically the same thing as posting your credit card details online.

<h1>Why does this exist?</h1>

Kinda bored. Kinda forgot python. Mostly just boredom though.

<h1>NOoOoO! You can't download my lion jpeg! ThAt'S mIne!</h1>

Give me your dumb tweet id and I'll get to it sometime. In the mean time look for your dick you bearded failure of a based femboy.

<h1>Why does this have a MYSQL client in it?</h1>

1. If some hypebeast wants to complain about being stolen from, I can just blacklist their shit and have the bot delete it from the miners system.
2. So everyone can get images and receive the same images without hitting bandwidth thresholds.
3. Because I also dunno what I want to do with all the images yet. Maybe a meme I dunno.
