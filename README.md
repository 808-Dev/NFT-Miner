# NFT Miner 
NFT Miner - Version 1.1.0 - Quick Fix

Since the whole NFT thing started booming on Twitter it's been hard not to see one of those ugly ass monkeys or lions in my fucking feed. I know you can mute stuff, but I'm petty. So, in response to these annoying as fuck incel hypebeasts shoving their picture of a lion that looks like it was dropped on its head, I created the worlds first NFT Miner.

#Does it mine crypto? 

No, but if you want to you can piss alot of people off with it.

#Is it illegal?

No, because it's basically the same thing as posting your credit card details online.

#Why does this exist?

Kinda bored. Kinda forgot python. Mostly just boredom though.

#You think it's funny to take screenshots of people's NFTs, huh? 
#Property theft is a joke to you? I'll have you know that the blockchain doesn't lie. I own it.
#Even if you save it, it's my property. You are mad that you don't own the art that I own.
#Delete that screenshot

Give me your dumb tweet id and I'll get to it sometime. In the mean time look for your dick you bearded failure of a based femboy.
